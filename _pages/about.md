I earned my B.Eng. degree in Communication Engineering from Wuyi University, Guangdong, China, in 2018. Subsequently, I completed my M.S. degree in Information and Communication Engineering at Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China, in 2021. Currently, I am a PhD candidate at the College of Electronics and Information Engineering, also at Shenzhen University. Additionally, I serve as a reviewer for IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS), IEEE Pattern Recognition (PR), and IEEE Transactions on Image and Video Processing (TIV). My research interests span trajectory prediction, anomaly detection, computer vision, and deep learning.
